  <h1>Nodestrong Product Overview</h1>
  
  <h2>Executive summary</h2>
  <h3>Trading strategy editor</h3>
  Nodestrong is a crypto defi analytics and trading strategy platform with which it is possible to create and backtest defi trading strategies.
  The trading strategy is formed by combining on-chain conditions into a sequence of "if then else" statements, defining when a token should be bought.
  There is a library of around 25 different conditions, and the user drag/drops them in an editor to form a complete strategy.<br><br>

  <h3>Backtesting</h3>
  The platform provides a backtester that runs the trading strategy on historical data. Once the backtest has completed,
  there is detailed information to know which tokens would have triggered, what was the entry value and what was the max value after the trigger. Detailed information
  such as number of swaps and liquidity is visible at a block granularity. Charts with the trigger point highlighted, and actual vs expected values in all the trading strategy conditions
  are visualisation helps to understand what happened throughout the backtest.<br><br>

  <h3>Live signals</h3>
  Each trading strategy is executed live at the head of the chain, on all the newly launched tokens and on each block. 
  The live view gives an overview of all the newest launches on Uniswap V2, and provides real time token data updates similar to other livepairs platforms.
  In the live view you can see which tokens have been triggered according to the active trading strategy.

  <h3>Discord and Telegram integration</h3>
  In order to get access to the tool, a user will have to join a community that has integrated the Nodestrong Discord or Telegram bot. The signals are received
  in the form of text messages inside the messaging app. Each signal contains basic information such as token name, contract addressa and links to charts. The user
  will then have to act on the signal and execute a buy if he/she so wishes. Integration with an external trade execution platform is a possibility but not foreseen
  as a native feature of Nodestrong.
  
  With the nature of crypto trading being "pvp" (player vs player), it can be of interest to keep a trading strategy algorithm restricted. As a user there are many variations
  on how restricted signals and trading strategies can be on the platform.
  
  The signals can be:
  <ul>
    <li>Common to all the members of a community, without any access to know what the actual trading strategy algorithm is (only reserved to community admins).</li>
    <li>Personal to a single member, with no access for anyone else from the community to either the signals nor the trading strategy algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Those are some examples and a tier level structure controls which features a community and member will have and with which flexibility.
