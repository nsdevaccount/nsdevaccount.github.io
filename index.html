  <h3>Trading strategy editor</h3>
  Nodestrong is a crypto defi analytics and trading strategy platform with which it is possible to create and backtest trading strategies.
  The trading strategy is formed by combining on-chain conditions into a sequence of "if then else" statements, forming the algorithm that defines when a token should be bought.
  There is a library of around 25 different conditions, and the user drag/drops them in a web-based editor to form a complete strategy.<br><br>

  <h3>Simulator for back testing</h3>
  The platform provides a backtester that runs the trading strategy on historical data. Once the backtest has completed,
  there is detailed information to know which tokens would have triggered, what was the entry value and what was the max value after the trigger.
  Data such as number of swaps and liquidity is visible at a block granularity. Charts with the trigger point highlighted, and actual vs expected values in all the trading strategy conditions
  are visualisation helps to understand what happened throughout the backtest.<br><br>

  </div><br>
  
  <h3>Live view and signals</h3>
  Each trading strategy is executed live at the head of the chain, on all the newly launched tokens and on each block. 
  The live view gives an overview of all the newest launches on Uniswap V2, and provides real time token data updates similar to other livepairs platforms.
  In the live view you can see which tokens have been triggered according to the active trading strategy.

  <h3>Discord and Telegram integration</h3>
  In order to get access to the tool, a user will have to join a community that has integrated the Nodestrong Discord or Telegram bot. The signals are received
  in the form of text messages inside the messaging app. Each signal contains basic information such as token name, contract addressa and links to charts. The user
  will then have to act on the signal and execute a buy if he/she so wishes. Integration with an external trade execution platform is a possibility but not foreseen
  as a native feature of Nodestrong.
  
  With the nature of crypto trading being "pvp" (player vs player), it can be of interest to keep a trading strategy algorithm restricted. As a user there are many variations
  on how restricted signals and trading strategies can be on the platform.
  
  The signals can be:
  <ul>
    <li>Common to all the members of a community, without any access to know what the actual trading strategy algorithm is (only reserved to community admins).</li>
    <li>Personal to a single member, with no access for anyone else from the community to either the signals nor the trading strategy algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Those are some examples and a tier level structure controls which features a community and member will have and with which flexibility.

  <h2>Product variations</h2>
  These are the core principles that lies behind Nodestrong. From these core ideas derives all the product variations and use cses.
  <ul>
    <li>Be able to create a no-code trading strategy with a drag/drop UI.</li>
    <li>Be able to define who has access to the trading strategy algorithm, from most to least granular level, (from individual user up to a full community).</li>
    <li>Be able to backtest and evaluate the effectiveness of the trading strategy on past data.</li>
    <li>Receive buy signals from a trading strategy into popular messaging platforms, such as Discord and Telegram.</li>
  </ul>

 In addition to the core ideas there are secondary capabilities or features such as
 <ul>
  <li>Have a live view that shows real time data of the latest launches on Uniswap.</li>
  <li>Charts that shows token price evolution and where you can see when a trade signal was triggered.</li>
  <li>Ability to go down to individual block level with a block-explorer type feature to analyse what happened in each block.</li>
  <li>A learning center where expert users can provide trading strategy ideas and defi data analytics insights to help other users.</li>
 </ul>
